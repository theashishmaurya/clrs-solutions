# Algorithms 1.1


## Getting Started with CLRS




#### 1.1-1 Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

##### Answer:

Sorting is a very common operation in real world. For example, when you are searching for a particular item in a list, you need to sort the list first. Sorting is also used in many other applications like searching, database, and many more.

Convex hull is a very common operation in real world. For example, when you are searching for a particular item in a list, you need to sort the list first. Sorting is also used in many other applications like searching, database, and many more.






#### 1.1-2 Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

##### Answer:

Other than speed, we can also use memory, power, and cost as a measure of efficiency in a real-world setting.

#### 1.1-3 Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

##### Answer:

Array is a data structure that we have seen previously. The strength of an array is that it is very easy to implement and it is very fast to access the elements. The limitation of an array is that it is fixed in size and it is not very flexible.

#### 1.1-4 How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

##### Answer:

The shortest-path problem is to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. The traveling-salesman problem is to find the shortest path that visits all the vertices in a graph. Both of these problems are similar in that they are both about finding the shortest path in a graph. However, the traveling-salesman problem is different from the shortest-path problem in that the traveling-salesman problem requires the path to visit all the vertices in the graph.

#### 1.1-5 Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.

##### Answer:

A real-world problem in which only the best solution will do: The design of a space shuttle re-entry system. The spacecraft must return to Earth and withstand the intense heat and friction generated by re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. A failure of the re-entry system could result in catastrophic loss of life and expensive equipment. In this scenario, it is imperative that the best possible solution is used to ensure the safe return of the spacecraft and its crew.

A real-world problem in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough: Recommender systems used by online shopping websites. Recommender systems use algorithms to suggest products to customers based on their browsing and purchase history. While it is important that these recommendations are accurate, they do not have to be perfect. A recommendation that is "approximately" the best, such as suggesting a product that is similar to what the customer has shown interest in, is often good enough to provide a positive customer experience and increase sales.
