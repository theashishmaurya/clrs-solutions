# Problems


### 1-1 Comparison of running times

For each function $f(n)$  and time $t$ in the following table, determine the largest size $n$ of a problem that can be solved in time $t$, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes $f(n)$ microseconds.


| $f(n)$ | 1 second | 1 minute | 1 hour | 1 day | 1 month | 1 year | 1 century |
|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|
| $log n$ | | | | | | | |
| $\sqrt{n}$ | | | | | | | |
| $n$ | | | | | | | |
| $n log n$ | | | | | | | |
| $n^2$ | | | | | | | |
| $n^3$ | | | | | | | |
| $2^n$ | | | | | | | |
| $n!$ | | | | | | | |
